How to contribute to the project
--------------------------------

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This documentation is written using sphinx_. It follows the `guidelines on writing technical documentation`_
set by Daniele Procida, and is contained in the ``docs`` directory of the project.

In order to contribute to the documentation, the following packages should be added to the virtualenv
on the developer machine:

.. code-block::

    sphinx
    sphinx-django-command
    sphinx-rtd-theme
    sphinx-autobuild
    pyembed-rst

Then, from inside the ``docs`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    make clean
    make build html

The ``makefile`` has been customised with respect to the original one generated by the ``sphinx-quickstart`` script,
and it contains a ``livehtml`` target, that allows to rebuild the html output each time the rst source files are
changed and saved.

.. code-block:: bash

    make livehtml
